the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place 
the jury further said in term end presentments that the city executive committee which had over all charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted 
the september october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard fought primary which was won by mayor nominate ivan allen jr 
only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city 
the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them 
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments 
merger proposed 
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration 
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem 
implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and re set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected 
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes 
this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money 
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties 
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers 
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation 
wards protected 
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee 
these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said 
regarding atlantas new multi million dollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences 
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable 
ask jail deputies 
on other matters the jury recommended that 1 four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail 2 fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes 
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department 
mayor william b hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife pearl williams hartsfield in fulton superior court friday his petition charged mental cruelty 
the couple was married aug 2 1913 they have a son william berry jr and a daughter mrs j m cheshire of griffin

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governors race a top official said wednesday 
robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience 
state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker 
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters 
despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended 
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents 
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken 1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 2 the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform 
sam caldwell state highway department public relations director resigned tuesday to work for lt gov garland byrds campaign

the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly 
before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made 
gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment vandiver likely will mention the 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item 
construction bonds 
meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds 
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways 
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some 3 million to 4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work 
a revolving fund 
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities 
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin 
the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds 
schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a 10 per day increase in expense allowances 
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought 
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87 31 
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29 5 as of sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action 
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions 
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past 
rep mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds 
barber who is in his 13th year as a legislator said there are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it the resolution passed but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution 
the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises colquitt after a long hot controversy miller county has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election i ever saw in this county 
the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee 
davis received 1119 votes in saturdays election and bush got 402 ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order 
this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said being at the polls was just like being at church i didnt smell a drop of liquor and we didnt have a bit of trouble 
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however it was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence 
the former county school superintendent george p callan shot himself to death march 18 four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board 
during the election campaign both candidates davis and bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls ordinary williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election 
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election 
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise 
everything went real smooth the sheriff said there wasnt a bit of trouble austin texas committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers 
daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation 
under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it 
daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug 31 
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more 
the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared 
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers 
if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said you take out of circulation many millions of dollars 
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies 
his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin 
cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts 
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday 
austin texas senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties 
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state 
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house 
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here 
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be 451500 which would be a savings of 157460 yearly after the first years capital outlay of 88000 was absorbed parkhouse told the senate 
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school 
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e red berry and joe ratcliff 
while details are still be to worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected 
were getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also im willing to stake my political career on it 
rep berry an ex gambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later 
the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities 
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar one validated acts of school districts another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district 
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted 
without dissent senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site 
two tax revision bills were passed one by sen louis crump of san saba would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a 1000 fine it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league 
the other bill by sen a m aikin jr of paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds 
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by sen frank owen 3 of el paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas 
marshall formby of plainview former chairman of the texas highway commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress eliminating the need for costly special elections 
under formbys plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the house attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court austin texas state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay 
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot when texas votes on a us senator 
rep wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill 
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb 22 the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by two thirds majorities before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot roberts said 
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice 
all dallas members voted with roberts except rep bill jones who was absent austin texas paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday 
rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of 250 people 
when the shouting ended the bill passed 114 to 4 sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas 
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse the bill would increase from 5000000 to 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project 
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas 
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway cottens attack 
the bills defenders were mostly small town legislators like j w buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs 
this is a poor boys bill said chapman dallas and fort worth can vote bonds this would help the little peanut districts 
austin texas 
a houston teacher now serving in the legislature proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods 
rep henry c grover who teaches history in the houston public schools would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so called teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate a normal years work in college is 30 semester hours 
grover also would require junior senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching 
the remainder of the 4 year college requirement would be in general subjects 
a person with a masters degree in physics chemistry math or english yet who has not taken education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools said grover 
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses 
fifty three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co signers of the proposal

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program the report culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load the report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and adc dependency must solve problem 
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 44 million dollars said c virgil martin president of carson pirie scott co committee chairman 
we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence martin said 
the volume of adc cases will decrease martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color these he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc 
calls for extension 
other recommendations made by the committee are extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity 
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy 
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial 
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements 30 a separate trial bellows made the request while the all woman jury was out of the courtroom 
fears prejudicial aspects 
the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others 
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this yes your honor replied bellows what this amounts to if true is that there will be a free for all fight in this case there is a conflict among the defendants washington july 24 president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio 
the president spent much of the week end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone 
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion 
decisions are made 
asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts 
salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city 
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means 
karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens 
karns ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor 
issue jury subpenas 
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury 
mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning 
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes 
actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court 
faced seven cases 
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another 
the cases involved judges in the 33d 24th and 42d precincts of the 31st ward the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward the 18th precinct of the 4th ward and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward 
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns two other cases also were under advisement 
claims precedent lacking 
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them washington feb 9 president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 142 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs 
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research 
the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill it was defeated in congress last year 
cost up to 37 a year 
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes 
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent 3 per cent on each worker and employer on the first 4800 of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5000 a year and the payroll tax to 65 per cent 325 per cent each similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system 
the payroll tax would actually rise to 75 per cent starting jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs 
outlays would increase 
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 15 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963 both figures would go higher in later years 
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes 
nursing home care 
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days 2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital a patient could receive up to 300 days paid for nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital care credit 3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient 4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness 
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged 
calls proposal modest 
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay 
this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals 
this is not a program of socialized medicine it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed every person will choose his own doctor and hospital 
wouldnt pay doctors 
the plan does not cover doctor bills they would still be paid by the patient 
apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools 
the president said the nations 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs 
contributions to schools 
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1500 a year for one fourth of the first year students the schools could use the money to pay 4 year scholarships based on need of up to 2000 a year per student 
in addition the government would pay a 1000 cost of education grant to the schools for each 1500 in scholarship grants officials estimated the combined programs would cost 51 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 
the president recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones 
more for nursing homes 
in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction he asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes 
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals 
in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute 
asks research funds 
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation he did not say by how much 
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase from 30 to 50 millions in matching grants for building research facilities the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540 million dollars in the 1961 62 budget for direct government research in medicine 
the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them 
reaction as expected 
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines legislators who last year opposed placing aged care under the social security system criticized the presidents plan those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message 
senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first 
house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house washington feb 9 acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief 
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard 
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency 
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor 
enforce by demand 
the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedys in 1961 oslo the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings 
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems 
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicious by its absence 
explosion avoided 
in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance 
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line 
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy 
exploratory mood 
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited 
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots 
the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months 
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters 
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole 
conflict surveyed 
the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east west friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection 
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent 
this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled washington the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time 
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos 
the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam 
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this 
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility 
policies modified 
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease fire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference 
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration 
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas 
but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises 
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression former vice president richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory 
gop restrained 
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba 
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first 
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination 
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators 
detente urged 
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds 
mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated 
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors 
aid plans revamped 
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration 
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed but thus far there has been no response in kind 
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations 
in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture 
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate 
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build up administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization 
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all out war over laos some seato nations disagreed however there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam 
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos the pro western government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army 
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro western government to the hilt 
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them 
one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna washington the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states 
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation 
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems
